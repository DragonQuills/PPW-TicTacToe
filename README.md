# PPW-TicTacToe
A TicTacToe game to practice Git and Github for Programming Project Workshop

Person 1: Kayden Adams
Person 2: Michael Ren

Our program simulates a TicTacToe game. It starts with Os and alternates turn by turn. During a turn, it prompts the user for an input of a row and column and the verifies the input. If it is correct and valid, it places the player's mark on that location on the board and then moves on the the next players turn.

It includes a Makefile and can be run from the command line using:

    make run
